# major project machine learning
In this project we have asked to take a dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and apply a suitable classifier regressor or clusterer and to calculate the accuracy of the model. 
For this project, I took a database containing information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic ship. The data set provides information about each passengerâ€™s, age, gender, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived the disaster. Then I performed the necessary Exploratory Data Analysis, like Data Summary, missing values analysis, etc. The last step was model building, which will use the data and evaluate the performance of the model.

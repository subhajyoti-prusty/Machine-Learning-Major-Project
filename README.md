Explanation of the Project code
The first two lines import the required libraries, pandas and numpy. Source is a string variable containing the URL of the dataset, which is then used in the pd.read_csv() function to read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame called Data.
 Then 'print(Data.head())' prints the first few rows of the dataset, 'print(Data.dtypes)' prints the data types of the columns in the dataset, 'print("The shape of the data: ",Data.shape)' prints the shape of the dataset, which is the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame, 'print("The size of the data: ",Data.size)' prints the size of the dataset, which is the total number of elements in the DataFrame, 'print(Data.info)' prints a summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null values, the data types of the columns, and the memory usage. and then 'print(Data[32:46])' slices the DataFrame from row 32 to row 46 and prints the resulting subset of the data, ‘print(Data.iloc[32:46,0:4])’ slices the DataFrame from row 32 to row 46 also slices from column 0 to column 3 and prints the resulting subset of the data, 'print(Data.Sex.nunique())' prints the number of unique values in the 'Sex' column of the DataFrame. 'print(Data.Sex.unique())' prints the unique values in the 'Sex' column of the DataFrame,which are male and female, 'print(Data.groupby('Survived').size())' groups the DataFrame by the 'Survived' column and prints the count of each group, 'print(Data.isnull().sum())' prints the count of missing values in each column of the DataFrame. ‘print(Data.isnull().mean() * 100)’ prints the percentage of missing values in each column of the DataFrame. 'print(Data.describe())' prints the summary statistics of the DataFrame, including the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values of the numerical columns.
After that 'Data.drop(['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1, inplace=True)' drops the columns 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin' from the DataFrame, since they are not relevant for the analysis. Then 'Data['Sex'] = np.where(Data['Sex'] == 'male', 0, 1)' converts the 'Sex' column to binary values, where 0 represents male and 1 represents female. Now 'Data['Age'].fillna(Data['Age'].median(), inplace=True)' fills the missing values in the 'Age' column with the median age of the dataset and 'Data['Embarked'].fillna(Data['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)' fills the missing values in the 'Embarked' column with the mode of the column.'Data['Embarked'] = Data['Embarked'].map({'S': 0, 'C': 1, 'Q': 2})' it converts the 'Embarked' column to numerical values, where 0 represents 'S', 1 represents 'C', and 2 represents 'Q'
The P variable contains the features of the dataset, which are all the columns except the Survived column. The Q variable contains the target variable, which is the Survived column. This code uses the 'train_test_split' function from Scikit-Learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The 'test_size' parameter is set to 0.2, which means that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% will be used for training. The 'random_state' parameter is set to 42 to ensure that the random splitting is reproducible. 'clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)'creates an instance of the Random Forest Classifier with 100 decision trees and fits the model on the training data. The 'random_state' parameter is set to 42 to ensure that the random initialization of the model is reproducible.
At the end, the model is trained to predict the survival of passengers in the testing set '(P_test)'. The predicted values are stored in 'Q_pred'. The accuracy of the model is then calculated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values '(Q_test)'. The 'accuracy_score' function from Scikit-Learn is used to calculate the accuracy. Finally, the accuracy is printed on the console.
